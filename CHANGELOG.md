## [v5.2.0]

### Added

- Add MCXL20 porting layer and unit testing
- New utility macro `RL_CALCULATE_BUFFER_COUNT_DOWN_SAFE` to safely determine maximum buffer count within shared memory while preventing integer underflow.
- RT700 platform add support for MCMGR in DSPs

### Changed

- Change `rpmsg_platform.c` to support new MCMGR API
- Improved input validation in initialization functions to properly handle insufficient memory size conditions.
- Refactored repeated buffer count calculation pattern for better code maintainability.
- To make sure that remote has already registered IRQ there is required App level IPC mechanism to notify master about it

### Fixed

- Fixed `env_wait_for_link_up` function to handle timeout in link state checks for baremetal and qnx environment, RL_BLOCK mode can be used to wait indefinitely.
- Fixed CERT-C INT31-C violation by adding compile-time check to ensure `RL_PLATFORM_HIGHEST_LINK_ID` remains within safe range for 16-bit casting in virtqueue ID creation.
- Fixed CERT-C INT30-C violations by adding protection against unsigned integer underflow in shared memory calculations, specifically in `shmem_length - (uint32_t)RL_VRING_OVERHEAD` and `shmem_length - 2U * shmem_config.vring_size` expressions.
- Fixed CERT INT31-C violation in `platform_interrupt_disable()` and similar functions by replacing unsafe cast from `uint32_t` to `int32_t` with a return of `0` constant.
- Fixed unsigned integer underflow in `rpmsg_lite_alloc_tx_buffer()` where subtracting header size from buffer size could wrap around if buffer was too small, potentially leading to incorrect buffer sizing.
- Fixed CERT-C INT31-C violation in `rpmsg_lite.c` where `size` parameter was cast from `uint32_t` to `uint16_t` without proper validation.
  - Applied consistent masking approach to both `size` and `flags` parameters: `(uint16_t)(value & 0xFFFFU)`.
  - This fix prevents potential data loss when size values exceed 65535.
- Fixed CERT INT31-C violation in `env_memset` functions by explicitly converting `int32_t` values to unsigned char using bit masking. This prevents potential data loss or misinterpretation when passing values outside the unsigned char range (0-255) to the standard memset() function.
- Fixed CERT-C INT31-C violations in RPMsg-Lite environment porting: Added validation checks for signed-to-unsigned integer conversions to prevent data loss and misinterpretation.
  - `rpmsg_env_freertos.c`: Added validation before converting int32_t to UBaseType_t.
  - `rpmsg_env_qnx.c`: Fixed format string and added validation before assigning to mqstat fields.
  - `rpmsg_env_threadx.c`: Added validation to prevent integer overflow and negative values.
  - `rpmsg_env_xos.c`: Added range checking before casting to uint16_t.
  - `rpmsg_env_zephyr.c`: Added validation before passing values to k_msgq_init.
- Fixed a CERT INT31-C compliance issue in `env_get_current_queue_size()` function where an unsigned queue count was cast to a signed int32_t without proper validation, which could lead to lost or misinterpreted data if queue size exceeded INT32_MAX.
- Fixed CERT INT31-C violation in `rpmsg_platform.c` where `memcmp()` return value (signed int) was compared with unsigned constant without proper type handling.
- Fixed CERT INT31-C violation in `rpmsg_platform.c` where casting from uint32_t to uint16_t could potentially result in data loss. Changed length variable type from uint16_t to uint32_t to properly handle memory address differences without truncation.
- Fixed potential integer overflow in `env_sleep_msec()` function in ThreadX environment implementation by rearranging calculation order in the sleep duration formula.
- Fixed CERT-C INT31-C violation in RPMsg-Lite where bitwise NOT operations on integer constants were performed in signed integer context before being cast to unsigned. This could potentially lead to misinterpreted data on `imx943` platform.
- Added RL_MAX_BUFFER_COUNT (32768U) and RL_MAX_VRING_ALIGN (65536U) limit to ensure alignment values cannot contribute to integer overflow
- Fixed CERT INT31-C violation in vring_need_event(), added cast to `uint16_t` for each operand.
